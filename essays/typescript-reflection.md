## First Impressions of TypeScript

I came into this course with experience in Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, and Python. TypeScript felt comparable in difficulty to what I already knew which made the transition smoother than expected. The main difference was handling types explicitly but that turned out to be less frustrating than I anticipated. TypeScript requires you to declare what kind of data you're working with upfront. It catches mistakes before they become runtime problems. Python lets you write code and discover errors when the program crashes. TypeScript warns you before you even run anything.

## WODs and How I Learn

The practice WODs turned out to be exactly what works for my learning style. I hyperfocus on one thing at a time. Multitasking kills the quality of my work. WODs force that kind of focus. You have a clear problem and a time limit. There's no room to get distracted when you're racing against a timer. What makes WODs useful is that failing doesn't matter during practice. I've failed practice WODs. You just try again. That removes the stress of needing to get it perfect the first time. I can attempt a problem see where I got stuck and immediately try a different approach. WODs let me iterate fast which matches how I actually learn things. The time pressure could feel stressful but I find it enjoyable. Problem solving under constraints forces you to think differently. You can't overthink things. You have to commit to an approach and execute it. When I fail a practice WOD it's obvious what went wrong. When I succeed I know exactly what worked. That immediate feedback loop keeps me engaged.

## This Style Works For Me

This style of learning fits how my brain works. I need to focus intensely on one thing rather than juggle multiple tasks. WODs give me that structure. The practice sessions let me fail without consequences. The timed aspect keeps me from overthinking. The immediate feedback shows me what I need to improve. The combination of TypeScript and athletic software engineering makes sense. TypeScript gives you guardrails. WODs train you to work within constraints. Both push you to be more deliberate about your code. I'm still early in the process but so far this matches how I learn better than most courses I've taken.
