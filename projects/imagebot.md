This project is an automation tool that monitors the screen for specific target images and automatically performs actions when they are detected. The bot continuously searches for up to four different images and executes predefined clicking sequences at specific coordinates. It also performs scheduled maintenance actions every five minutes with alternating scroll patterns to maintain activity.

I was the sole developer of this automation tool. I designed the GUI interface, implemented the image recognition system with variable tolerance levels, and programmed the click sequences and timing logic. I also handled DPI scaling compatibility and created percentage-based positioning to ensure the bot works across different screen resolutions.

Through this project, I learned how to work with AutoHotkey v2.0 and implement image recognition for automation tasks. I gained experience with coordinate systems, DPI scaling, and creating responsive GUI applications. The project taught me about timer-based programming and the importance of error handling in automation scripts that run continuously.
